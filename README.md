Rotate lines
============

This is a observation rotation utility (at least that is what I'm rotating).

See [`./src/main.ts`](./src/main.ts) reads the `./in.txt` file and then
rotates its lines by parts, and generates the `./out/n*.txt` and testing
`./out/n*t.txt` files when we run `npm test`.

## Development

Use `npm run test:watch` to automatically rerun the test command to check the output.
